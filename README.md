# Titanic_Datset_Analysis

The main goal of EDA using this dataset is to explore the data, understand its structure and relationships, and derive insights that can be useful for making predictions about passenger survival. Common EDA tasks with this dataset include:  Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers. Data Visualization: Creating plots and charts to visualize the distribution of data, such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots. Statistical Summary: Calculating summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones if needed. Correlation Analysis: Examining correlations between variables to identify relationships. Survival Analysis: Exploring survival rates based on different factors like gender, class, or age. Data Transformation: Preparing the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features. Hypothesis Testing: Testing hypotheses about the dataset, such as whether there is a significant difference in survival rates between different groups.
